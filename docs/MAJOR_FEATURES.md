## ðŸ›  Development Guidelines

1. **Ticket Integration**:
   - Every feature must have a corresponding ticket (e.g., PH-XXX).
   - Link the ticket number in parentheses next to each feature.
   - Update this document when major tickets are created.

2. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Mark completed features with [x] instead of [ ].
   - For partial progress, note percentage: [ ] Feature (75%).
   - Update during sprint reviews or milestone completions.

3. **Prioritization**:
   - Features are listed by MVP critical path first, then by "Post-MVP" desirability.
   - If priorities shift, document the changes through tickets.

4. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Adhoc scripts must reference ticket numbers in filename: PH-123_my_script_description.py.
   - Ticket naming and feature names must remain consistent for traceability.

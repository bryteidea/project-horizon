Project Horizon solves common development challenges while encouraging personal creative expression:

1. **Consistency Problem**: Different projects with wildly varying structures make onboarding difficult
2. **Framework Lock-in**: Being unable to switch frameworks when requirements change
3. **AI Assistance Limitations**: Most project structures aren't optimized for AI-assisted development
4. **Creative Expression**: Traditional project structures lack personality and creative direction

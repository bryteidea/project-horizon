# PH-001 – User Authentication System

## Title
Implement user authentication system with registration, login, and password reset

## Type
Feature

## Priority
High

## Description
We need to implement a secure user authentication system to allow users to register, login, and reset their passwords. This is a foundational feature required before we can implement any user-specific functionality.

The system should provide a seamless experience while following security best practices for password storage and account management. It should include protection against common attacks (brute force, session hijacking).

## Tasks
1. Design database schema for user accounts
   - User table with username, email, password hash, roles
   - Session tracking table
   - Password reset tokens table
2. Implement backend authentication routes
   - Registration with email verification
   - Login with JWT token issuance
   - Password reset flow
   - Account management endpoints
3. Implement frontend user interfaces
   - Registration form with validation
   - Login form with error handling
   - Forgot password flow
4. Add security measures
   - Password strength enforcement
   - Rate limiting
   - Session management
5. Create comprehensive tests
   - Unit tests for authentication logic
   - Integration tests for end-to-end flows
   - Security tests for vulnerability checks

## Implementation Details
- **Technical approach**: Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication
- **Password storage**: Argon2id hashing with salt
- **Libraries**: 
  - Backend: Flask-Security or FastAPI security extensions
  - Frontend: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Email verification**: Send one-time tokens via SendGrid
- **Security considerations**: 
  - Implement rate limiting (max 5 failed attempts per minute)
  - JWT expiry of 24 hours, refresh tokens with 30-day expiry
  - HTTPS only for all auth endpoints

## Expected Results
- New users can register accounts with email verification
- Users can log in securely and access protected resources
- Forgotten passwords can be reset via email flow
- Admin users can manage user accounts
- Security metrics:
  - Registration to login flow < 1 minute
  - Password reset flow < 2 minutes
  - Zero high-severity vulnerabilities in security scan

- [JWT Authentication Flow Diagram](https://assets/diagrams/auth_flow.png)
- [Security Requirements Document](docs/security/requirements.md)
- Sample test accounts in test database

## Validation
- **Testing approach**:
  - Unit tests for all authentication functions
  - Integration tests for complete flows
  - Manual testing of edge cases (invalid emails, password variations)
- **Edge cases**:
  - User forgets password immediately after registration
  - Multiple reset password requests
  - Concurrent login attempts from different devices
  - Expired tokens being used
- **Definition of Done**:
  - All tests passing (unit, integration, security)
  - Code reviewed by at least one senior developer
  - Documentation updated
  - UI/UX approved by design team
